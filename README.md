# Andorid-Take-Pic-Make-Movie-SMS/No xml Layouts


# This is created in response of 100s of Stackoverflow or Gits or many more pages about taking pic and recording videos in Android. but i found not a single practicle working example. millions of pages on this topic just giving a glimpse and i always beleave that if you are telling some one tell him with honesty not to conceal so i make a multitasking app which has broader features like gps positioning, takepic from ffmpeg which works quickly as you can take per pic in a millisecond click, ffpmeg video recording in h264 or else format, face recognition,gps on map live, sms or email position, record screen, stream screen. my stream screen example is alredy released in my other repo. but i am sharing six of its features now.

A 100% working app which Privdes java code to Multitask as following.

Task 1- Take Pciture/Macke movie while Listening/Bluetooth Music as Defaualt camera app of android stop the background music so if we are Bluetoothing Music in Party from our mobile so we cant use it to take pics or make movie but with this app you can simultanously do it.

Task 2- SMS while camera view is at background so you can watch your footstep may be a Gutter is open or a ladder or hurdle.

Task 3- in SMSREceiver.java change the login name and password of your email to receive every received and sent sms to your email.

Task 4- All the files contain no link to any xml file for layouts so we just only have to copy .java files to a project and we are good to go.

Task 5 - Clickable/vertically scrollable Phone numbers canvas that can open chat box and a Horozontally and Vertically Scrorrlable canvas to show the text of sms recived and sent.
