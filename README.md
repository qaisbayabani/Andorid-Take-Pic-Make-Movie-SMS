# Andorid-Take-Pic-Make-Movie-SMS/No xml Layouts


# This is created in response of 100s of Stackoverflow or Gits or many more pages about taking pic and recording videos in Android. but i found not a single practicle working example. millions of pages on this topic just giving a glimpse and i always beleave that if you are telling some one tell him with honesty not to conceal so i make a multitasking app which has broader features like gps positioning, take pic from default camera call back(very slow), takepic from ffmpeg which works quickly as you can take per pic in a millisecond click,make movie from default recorder(takes too much space but maximum high quality), ffpmeg video recording in h264 or else format (save space excelently), face recognition, gps on map live, sms or email position, recd screen, stream screen. my stream screen example is alredy released in my other repo. 

# but i am sharing only six of its features now. This project did not use any xml layout

A 100% working app which Privdes java code to Multitask as following.

Task 1- Take Pciture(Default Camera Callback, slower)/Make movie(non ffpmpeg converter heavy format but max quality) while Listening/Bluetooth Music. Defaualt camera app of android stop the background music so if we are Bluetoothing Music in Party from our mobile, we cant use it to take pics or make movie but with this app you can simultanously do it.

Task 2- SMS while camera view is at background so you can watch your footstep may be a Gutter is open or a ladder or hurdle.

Task 3- in SMSREceiver.java change the login name and password of your email to receive every received and sent sms to your email.

Task 4- All the files contain no link to any xml file for layouts so we just only have to copy .java files to a project and we are good to go.

Task 5 - Clickable/vertically scrollable Phone numbers canvas that can open chat box.
 Chat box with camera background Horozontally and Vertically Scrorrlable canvas to show the text of sms recived and sent.
